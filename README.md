# PodcastAI - Intelligent Podcast Recommendation System

A sophisticated multi-agent AI system that provides personalized podcast recommendations using advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and intelligent recommendation algorithms.

## System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Architecture

The system employs three specialized AI agents working in harmony:

**Spotify API Agent**
- Handles podcast retrieval from Spotify API
- Manages authentication and rate limiting
- Processes and standardizes podcast data
- Provides trending and search functionality

**User Preference Agent**
- Tracks user search history and interactions
- Analyzes user behavior patterns
- Stores preferences in MongoDB
- Provides preference data to recommendation engine

**Recommendation Agent**
- Generates personalized recommendations
- Communicates with User Preference Agent
- Uses content-based and collaborative filtering
- Integrates OpenAI GPT for semantic understanding

### Data Flow

```
User Search → Spotify API Agent → Podcast Results → User Preference Agent (logs search)
User Request → Recommendation Agent → User Preference Agent (gets preferences) → Spotify API Agent (fetches relevant content) → Personalized Recommendations
```

### Technology Stack

**Backend**
- FastAPI for REST API
- MongoDB for data storage
- OpenAI GPT for AI processing
- Spotify API for podcast data

**Frontend**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Redux Toolkit for state management

## Agent Roles and Communication Flow

### Agent Responsibilities

**Spotify API Agent**
- Authenticate with Spotify API
- Search podcast episodes by query
- Fetch trending content
- Convert Spotify data to standardized format

**User Preference Agent**
- Log user search queries with timestamps
- Analyze search frequency and patterns
- Store user preferences and behavior data
- Provide preference insights to other agents

**Recommendation Agent**
- Request user preferences from User Preference Agent
- Apply multiple recommendation strategies
- Generate personalized podcast suggestions
- Provide reasoning for recommendations

### Communication Protocol

1. **Search Flow**: User searches → Spotify Agent retrieves → User Preference Agent logs
2. **Recommendation Flow**: User requests recommendations → Recommendation Agent queries User Preference Agent → Gets preferences → Uses Spotify Agent to fetch relevant content → Returns personalized results
